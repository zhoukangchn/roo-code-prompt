# 📚 Mode Mappings
If I ask you to use a specific mode, refer to the corresponding template in `%USERPROFILE%\roo-code-prompt\README.md`:
- **Architect Mode**: High-level design and planning.
- **Developer Mode**: TDD-focused implementation.
- **Debug Mode**: Error analysis and root cause discovery.
- **The Exec Mode**: Precision code replacement for complex edits.
